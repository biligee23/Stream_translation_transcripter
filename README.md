# Stream_translation_transcripter
I like watching Vtubers, but I do not know Japanese well, so I resort to watching translated clips on YouTube. However, I want to start watching them via live stream to engage more. This is a tool that receives system audio from the PC to first provide speech-to-text using Vosk in Japanese, then translates it into English using a Marian MT model.
